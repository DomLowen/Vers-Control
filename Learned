Though I am new to coding entirely, the general interface seems pretty easy to use. In the assignment I learned about branches and forks for editing my projects, as 
well as how to create repositories and managing my different projects. Not necessarily confused, but wondering how all these applications will tie into the actual coding, 
though I know we will get to it eventually. I chose the MIT License because based off its description of simplicity and accessability to others. If we are to be working in
groups and sharing the code for revision, it seems to be the best choice.
